You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 687ae3d25 Merged in fix/matlab_wrapper_scalar_references (pull request #287)

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:297 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmetis_catkin.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "metis_catkin", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "metis_catkin" with
  any of the following names:

    metis_catkinConfig.cmake
    metis_catkin-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "metis_catkin" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "metis_catkin_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "metis_catkin" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
