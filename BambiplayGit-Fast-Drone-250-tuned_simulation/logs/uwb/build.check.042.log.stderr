  By not providing "Findmetis.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "metis", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "metis" with any of
  the following names:

    metisConfig.cmake
    metis-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "metis" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "metis_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "metis"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
